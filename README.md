TurtleRecorder
==============

Draw a path for a turtle (Turtle graphics) to follow! Generates code for the path drawn.

Instructions:

Run main.py to start the program. Be sure to have the proper dependencies (like py2exe if you're running it on windows). Tested with Python 2.7.

When running the program, click in the giant area below the buttons. Draw something. 
Feel free to change colors and reset the canvas at will. 
Press Demo to the view the turtle graphics that correspond to the drawing.
When complete, press Done. On Windows, an executable and accompanying code will be generated (including the python source). On Linux, a python file will instead be created.

Enjoy.
